# 🗂️ File Organizer Script (Python)

A simple and effective Python script to automatically organize files in a given directory.  
It sorts files by type (e.g. Images, PDFs, Code, etc.) into relevant folders — creating those folders if they don’t already exist.

---

## 📦 How to Use

1. Save the script as `organize_files.py`.
2. Replace `./your-folder-path-here` in the script with your actual folder path.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python organize_files.py
```
